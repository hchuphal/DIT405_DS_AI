    "The exercise takes place in a notebook environment where you can chose to use Jupyter or Google Colabs. We recommend you use Google Colabs as it will facilitate remote group-work and makes the assignment less technical. \n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "You can execute certain linux shell commands by prefixing the command with `!`. You can insert Markdown cells and code cells. The first you can use for documenting and explaining your results the second you can use writing code snippets that execute the tasks required.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will implement a Naïve Bayes classifier in Python that will classify emails into spam and non-spam (“ham”) classes.  Your program should be able to train on a given set of spam and “ham” datasets. \n",
    "You will work with the datasets available at https://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/. There are three types of files in this location: \n",
    "-\teasy-ham: non-spam messages typically quite easy to differentiate from spam messages. \n",

    "**Execute the cell below to download and extract the data into the environment of the notebook -- it will take a few seconds.** If you chose to use Jupyter notebooks you will have to run the commands in the cell below on your local computer, with Windows you can use 7zip (https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) to decompress the data.\n",
